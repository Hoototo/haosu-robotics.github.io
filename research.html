                                  <p class="indent-right">We are developing next generation soft wearable robots that use innovative textiles to provide a more conformal, unobtrusive and compliant means to interface to the human body. These robots will augment the capabilities of healthy individuals (e.g. improved walking efficiency) in addition to assisting those with muscle weakness or patients who suffer from physical or neurological disorders. As compared to a traditional exoskeleton, these systems have several advantages: the wearer's joints are unconstrained by external rigid structures, and the worn part of the suit is extremely light.  These properties minimize the suit's unintentional interference with the body's natural biomechanics and allow for more synergistic interaction with the wearer.

                                <p>In this collaborative work between Harvard and Columbia, we  have developed a modular, computationally-distributed multi-robot cyberphysical  system (CPS) for gait rehabilitation of developmentally-delayed children. It  addresses the research target area of new CPS technology by introducing a  multi-robot system: 1) a multi-cable scaffold robot that continuously modulates  the stabilization of medio-lateral and anterior-posterior sway, and 2) a soft,  wearable, exosuit robot with embedded sensing and actuation, which assists with  stance push off and swing flexion. My role is to develop an IMU based gait  detection and control strategy to assist and coordinate pelvic motion and hip  flexion motion. This novel method is adaptive to different subjects and  different gaits. Those assistive robots aim to provide both orthotic and therapeutic  effect to children with cerebral palsy. The long term goal is to develop an  autonomous wearable robot for rehabilitation and ambulation assistance in daily  life.</p>

The objective is to make conventional diagnostic closed high-field (1.5T - 3T) MRI scanners available for guiding stereotatic needle placement interventions for treatment of brain metastases and other neurological disorders including severe depression and Alzheimer's Disease. This is accomplished through the use of a robotic image-guided therapy system that offers significant improvements, including reductions in surgical time and morbidity, and enhanced accuracy and safety, over existing treatment methods.

The robotic system, designed to improve prostate cancer biopsies, is being tested as part of a larger clinical trial at BWH. The first generation is a cylidrical needle placement robot, the 2nd generation utilized a concentric tube mechanism to actively steer needles, and the third generation deploys a parallel mechanism for angulated needle placement. Prostate cancer is the last form of cancer still diagnosed with blind needle biopsies, so we are working to change that with image-guided technology. </p>

A novel, compact opto-mechanical FPI sensor interface is integrated into an MRI robot control system.A pneumatically actuated haptic master robot is  developed to render force associated with needle placement interventions to the clinician. An aluminum load cell is implemented and calibrated to close the impedance control loop of the master robot. A force-position control algorithm is developed to control the hybrid actuated system. Teleoperated needle insertion is demonstrated under live MR imaging, where the slave robot resides in the scanner bore and the user manipulates the master beside the patient outside the bore. </p>

We are evaluating and developing sensors to be used in the MR environment.
