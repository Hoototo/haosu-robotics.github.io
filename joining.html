                  <p align="justify" ><strong>Open   Postdoc and PhD  Positions </strong><strong>in Robotics (Design and Control) </strong></p>
                  <p align="justify" ><strong>Postdoc fellow</strong>s<br>
  We invite applications for two open postdoctoral fellow positions focused on robot design and robot control  algorithm development. Our work is in collaboration with Cornell University, Harvard University and several top medical schools in U.S.. </p>
                  <p><strong>Position #1</strong>: Mechanical design of soft robots, including wearable robots for patients with impairments and steerable surgical robots. Knowledge in actuator design, cable transmission, series elastic actuators, high torque density acutators, or pneumatics is a plus.   </p>
                  <p><strong>Position #2</strong>: Developing learning and control algorithms that enable semi-autonomous manipulation of our soft exoskeleton robot or soft  bi-mannual humanoid robot platform. This is a great opportunity to lead a new research direction on a new generation of wearable robots and humanoid robot platform with several PIs who have expertise in mechatronics, computer vision and machine learning.   </p>
                  <p>For both positions, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a related field is required. Candidates will be expected to carry out a creative and independent research agenda, publish scholarly papers, and take on a mentorship role for undergraduate and graduate students at CCNY. </p>
                  <p>Applications (assembled as a single PDF file) should contain a complete CV, a cover letter describing research interests and goals, a complete list of publications, copies of up to three relevant scientific papers, and the names and contact information of three references (expected to provide letters of recommendation). Applications should be emailed to Hao Su (hao.su at ccny.cuny.edu) with the subject line &ldquo;Postdoc 2018 application&rdquo;.                  </p>
                  <p align="justify" ><strong>Graduate student  researchers</strong><br>
                    PhD  students can be admitted in 2018 Fall or 2019 Spring. PhD students will receive   tuition waiver and stipend support. Applicants are expected to have strong background  in robot design and control systems. Undergraduate or  Master students with strong skills will be considered with financial support. <br>
  <strong>Undergraduate  research opportunities</strong><br>
                    We  welcome undergraduates who are interested in gaining research experience in the  areas of robotics, including but not limited to mechanical design, embedded system,  controls, design of sensors and actuators. Students looking for internship are  also welcome.<br>
